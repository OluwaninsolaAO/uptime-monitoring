    👋 Hello World! 

    🔍 This status page is powered by the awesome **Upptime** and fueled by 
    approximately 37 cups of coffee ☕ (and counting).
    <br><br>
    🤖 We're keeping a watchful eye on my side projects, making sure they don't decide to take an unscheduled nap. No servers were harmed while making this page - we're running on pure GitHub magic! ✨
    <br><br>
    🎭 Watch the drama unfold in real time as we track the pulse of each project. Will they thrive? Will they survive? Stay tuned!
    <br><br>
    Remember: In the world of side projects, uptime is just a state of mind... but it's nice to know anyway! 😉
